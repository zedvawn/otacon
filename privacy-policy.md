# Otacon Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains what data Otacon collects, how it’s used, and how you can request its removal. By using Otacon, you consent to the collection and use of information as described here.

## 1. Information We Collect

Otacon only collects the minimum data required for functionality within Discord. This includes:

- User ID: Used to associate your data with your Discord account.

- Guild (Server) ID: Used to store server-specific settings and economy data.

- Economy balance and game data: Used to track progress, currency, and scores.

- Command usage statistics: Used internally to measure performance and improve features.

Otacon does not collect any personally identifiable information beyond what Discord provides by default through its API.

## 2. How We Use the Data

Collected data is used for:

- Saving user progress and economy balances.

- Maintaining per-server configurations and leaderboards.

- Monitoring bot performance and preventing abuse.

- Debugging and improving the bot’s commands and systems.

- Data is never sold, shared, or distributed to third parties.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

All data is stored securely in a private database accessible only to the developer, zedvawn.
Reasonable measures are taken to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or deletion of data.

## 4. Data Retention

User and guild data is retained as long as the bot is active in the server or until a deletion request is made.

If Otacon is removed from a server, related guild data may be purged automatically after a set period.

Data may also be cleared during database maintenance or when resetting features (e.g., leaderboards or balances).

## 5. Data Removal Requests

Users or server owners may request deletion of their stored data at any time.
To request deletion, please contact the developer with:

- Your Discord User ID or Server ID

Your data will be deleted within a reasonable timeframe.
 
## 6. Third-Party Services
